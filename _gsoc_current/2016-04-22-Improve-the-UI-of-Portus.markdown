Currently, Portus has a Bootstrap based user interface. But still has some responsivity issues , specially on small screens. So, one of the focuses of this project is to ensure that users have a good experiences when using Portus in all devices.

Furthermore, Portus also need some improvements, both in performance as well new features. Within these needs we have the creation of new filters, search improvements and serve assets only when used.

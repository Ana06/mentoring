OSEM already has a feature to sell conference tickets to its attendees. At the
moment the user has to buy the ticket online and pay on arrival at the
conference. OSEM currently lacks the ability for a user to pay for its tickets
as per their convenience. In this project, we aim to fill this gap in
functionality by adding online ticket payment feature. This will improve user
experience by making the ticket purchase workflow smoother.

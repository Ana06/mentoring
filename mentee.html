        <h3>1. Understand the goal</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of all of this is to guide you on becoming a regular contributor
          to Free Software. It's as much about building relationships, learning
          how we communicate and collaborate as it is about hacking code
          and using tools. This is about you becoming a full-fledged contributor
          to openSUSE!
        </p>
        <p>
          That also means that the goal of this program is not to teach you the
          basics of software development. Those skills can best be required
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Open_educational_resources">elsewhere</a>
          and we expect you to have them.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Help us to get to know you</h3>
        <p>
          We are here for you to talk about every
          aspect of this process. Introduce yourself on our
          <a href="mailto: opensuse-project@opensuse.org">mailing list</a>
          ("Hey I'm thinking about becoming a mentee in 101 and I'm not
          sure about XXX and have questions about YYY"), chat with us on
          <a href="irc://irc.opensuse.org/openSUSE-project">IRC</a> and if you're
          already sure about your project, introduce yourself to the mentor directly.
          And even if you're not sure that you want to do this at all, come talk
          to us and we will find out together if this is for you or not.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Be courageous and committed</h3>
        <p>
          Find a project that challenges and that exites you. But think about your
          choice carefully, you're going to be doing it for a while. And while
          you are at it we expect you to be self-motivated and proactive. This
          will work out best if you choose the right thing to do, if you build a
          relationship with your mentor, set realistic goals and if you're willing
          to respond to change.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Communicate</h3>
        <p>
          In our community people with different levels of expertise,
          speaking different languages and having different cultural backgrounds
          openly share their ideas. That's why communication is king. We expect
          you to communicate daily with your mentor, to write short reports at least
          once a week and we expect that you tell us if there is something you
          can't do. Share what you are up to, share your challenges and share
          what you have learned. Open, honest and prompt communication is the key
          to success!
        </p>
        <h3>5. Collaborate</h3>
        <p>
          Make your code readable and understandable by everyone else in the project.
          Document code that isn't obvious. Commit your code early, commit often.
          Get your code reviewed and review code of others as often as you can.
          Make sure everyone can use, share, study, modify, and share
          modified versions of what you produce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accept that there are different ways to work and different goals for
          people. Respect people and their contributions, respect other opinions
          and beliefs. Listen to arguments and address problems in a constructive
          and open way. A diverse community based on mutual respect is the base
          for a creative and productive environment.
